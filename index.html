  			<h1>HOW  TO: Create an Original Character</h1>
			<p> The recipe for creating an original character is not cut and dry; everyone's processes are different. But if you're like most artists, sometimes it can be extremely hard to conjur up a person that doesn't exist. <br>Working from references and models is something we do on a regular basis! So how do we come up with someone out of thin air? </p>

    		<h3> Take it easy!</h3>
    		<p> What person do you know was born with a personality before a name? A lot of people make the mistake of thinking up a really crazy character and then coming up with a name which is when we end up with characters called "Fireslasher" and "Rager" (Not that those are <i> that</i> bad!) Try thinking of your character's birth name; a more common one with a first and last name. This way, if you have a super cool character with fire powers for example, you can give him a super cool civilian name like Andrew Collins but also give him an awesome nickname like "Fire Fist" as his hero name.</p>

    		<h3> Remember your roots!</h3>
    		<p> Names often are influenced by a character's culture and region. Depending on their background, they may have a special name that comes from that culture. Taking this into account can really add to the story. Doing your research on names will make your character even more awesome than they probably already are!</p>
		<hr>
			<h3> Back to the future </h3>
    		<p> The stories and experiences we gain and build throughout out our lives is what makes us who we are currently. It is beneficial to begin thinking about a character's backstory before their current one. Where did they come from? What was their childhood like? What were the influences that caused them to behave the way they do now? Planning all of this out can really help shape your character's path as well as help to omit any possiblity of plotholes or continuity errors in the story!</p>

		<hr>
   			<h3>It's ok to be materialistic!</h3>
    		<p> For the most part, a person's personality influences their outward appearance. Neat and tidy people often wear clean plain clothing. Fighters often wear clothes that give them room for movement and will sometimes be tattered or show signs of wear. A person should be ready for whatever adventure they'll go on while also reflecting who they are. It could be beneficial to design a mock wardrobe for your character! Grabbing photos off the web and compiling a collection of inspiration could help make the process easier. Also, think about items they may carry from their past. Did they inherit a locket from their mother? Has the weapon they've been carrying on their hip been passed down through centuries of ancestors? Try to incoporate these things into your character so that it'll create more dimensions to their lives.</p>

    		<h3>Biology and appearance</h3>
    		<p>During this stage, you must also figure out what the character themselves will look like! Are they human or some kind of creature? What colour are their eyes? Even thinking about the way their parents look can help to develop this step. When developing a character's looks, you should also take into account their past encounters, fights etc. and then add these scars, wounds or enhancements to their looks. By then, you should have a pretty great idea of what you want them to look like. </p>

   			<h3>Your OC- Where are they now?</h3>
    		<p> Don't forget to update their looks as the story progresses. Battle scars, items picked up along the way and signs of aging should be added throughout the story! Not only will it add to their coolness factor, but these small additions can help support the continuity of the story. </p>

		<hr>
    		<p> *Note* This step is totally optional! Not everyone has to be superhuman :)</p>
    		<h3> Your character is not God (Though they can be one!) </h3>
			<p> It's not the best idea to make your character an all powerful being right away. A character with a god complex can often come across as boring and uninteresting. A character that is rediculously strong and cannot be beaten will never be anyone's favourite character. Leaving no room for development and no room for failure can really dull a person and make what you thought was cool, totally uncool. There is no reason to not develop a god like character, but leave their full fledged power 'til the end of the story! Show your audience how they got to where they are. Allow them to be beaten sometimes and show how they've grown from their experiences. Seeing the progression of a god would be much more interesting than observing their full power right off the bat.</p>

    		<h3> Going back to the past!</h3>
    		<p> Just like every other aspect of a person, their past and personality will influence any power they develop. Are they hot headed and mean? A fire power or over exxagerated strength may be good for them! Are they sporty and energetic? Why not give them the power of speed or the ability to breathe underwater while they swim? Connecting a personality to as power can maker it seem more believable!</p>

    		<h2>And there you have it!</h2>
    		<p> You should now have a well flushed out original character, or at least a skeleton of what you want them to be. These are not instructions, but suggestions on how to make this tough process a little easier. I reccomend making a "Meet my OC" post on social media or even just for yourself which shows a clear visualization of their clothes, powers and personality as well as a short profile on who they are. This'll get both you and your viewers excited for your new character! Scroll up to see an example!</p>
